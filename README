AnonymousUser
=============

This generator will create an AnonymousUser model. You can call AnonymousUser::get(request.remote_ip, cookies)
in a controller (or view) to get an AnonymousUser instance for the current user. The instance is based on IP of the remote
client OR cookie. If a user hasn't got a cookie but his IP is already assigned to an AnonymousUser, the get
method will return that user. If a user has a cookie but the IP is not yet assigned, the get method will return
the user with the cookie value. A new user is automatically created when there is no existing user with this IP
or cookie value.


Example
=======

This plugin was created to allow anonymous rating with Ajaxful Rating plugin. For example you could add this to
your application controller:

  helper_method :current_user
  
  def current_user
    AnonymousUser::get(request.remote_ip, cookies)
  end
